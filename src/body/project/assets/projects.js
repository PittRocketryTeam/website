                "far the lightest, and have the highest thrust, but are the ",
                "least propellant-efficient (they have the lowest specific ",
                "impulse). The ideal exhaust is hydrogen, the lightest of all ",
                "gases, but chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, ",
                "reducing the exhaust velocity. Rocket engines become more ",
                "efficient at high velocities, due to greater propulsive ",
                "efficiency and the Oberth effect. Since they do not require an ",
                "atmosphere, they are well suited for uses at very high altitudes ",
